          shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and
          structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating
          different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.

          Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines.[1] These
          beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and
          cultural rolesâ€”often driving local tourism industries. To support
          these uses, some beaches have human-made infrastructure, such as
          lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may
          also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and
          restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal
          residents.

          Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are
          not developed for tourism or recreation. Preserved beaches are
          important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine
          biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting
          areas for seabirds or penguins. Preserved beaches and their associated
          dune are important for protection from extreme weather for inland
          ecosystems and human infrastructure.[1]
